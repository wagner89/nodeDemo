# nodeDemo
Empty `nodeJS`/`express`/`react`/`SASS`/`webpack`/`babel` project skeleton

# Setup

1. Make sure you have `npm`, `node` and `babel` installed
2. Clone the repository
3. From root of the repo run `npm install`  (or `yarn`) to retrieve dependencies
4. From root of the repo run `npm run server`
5. From your browser open [localhost:4000] or [localhost:4000/api] to verify that express/react are both working

This is enough to get you started with a new nodeJS project, with an express server, rebuilt by babel upon server side code changes,
with react on the front-end handeled by webpack, and syled by SASS or CSS. 

## Have fun!
